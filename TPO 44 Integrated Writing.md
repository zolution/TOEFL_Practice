Both the reading passage and the lecture discuss about whether the silver coins discovered in the North America brought by the European explorers such as the Norse. The reading passage implies that the coins were by no means brought by the Europeans, and mentions three supporting examples. However, the lecturer strongly disagrees with such points of view, and provided three refutations to counter those examples in the reading passage.

First of all, the reading passage mentions the great distance between the archeological site and the Norse settlement, which implies that thereâ€™s no possibilities the silver coins can be brought to the site by the Norse. However, the lecturer challenged this claim since the Native American travels long and migrates. In addition, they will bring the objects along with them. Therefore, it is possible that the silver coin is brought from the Norse settlement to the historical site by the Native American after the Norse brought the coins to the North America.

Next, the passage suggests that there is no other coin found in the Norse settlement. Nevertheless, the professor again challenges this theory by arguing that the Norse has no permanent place to live. Consequently, when the Norse came back to the Europe, they would bring their belongings along with them. That is to say, it is quite reasonable that the valuable silver coins were not left in the settlement at all. As a result, the proof provided in the passage is not sufficient.

Last but not least, the article claims that the silver coins were not used as currency by the Native Americans, and the Norse, experiences explorers, must have already known the fact. However, the lecturer doubted this claim because the silver coins are beautiful and interesting to the Native Americans, and they can make jewelry or accessories with the coins. Due to their interest, the Europeans can trade something valuable with the Americans by the silver coins. Accordingly, despite the coins are not used as currency, they can still be tradable goods and gives the Norse motivation to bring the coins to the North America.

To sum up, the professor argues against the claims in the article by providing refutations one by one. That is to say, he believes that the silver coin is still a genuine historical evidence of such era.
