​            Pioneering technology are changing the way people communicate with each other from time to time, and utilizing the power of technology to communicate becomes a trend in the society. Some people accept such new communication approach and adapt to it, while others argue that people should not spend too much time on these brand-new communication technologies. In my opinion, I considerably contend that people should spend time on communicating through technologies.

​            First of all, in the current society, people put strong emphasis on efficiency, and such technologies can definitely enhance the efficiency of communication. For instance, when we need to contact someone, the first thing bumps into our mind is real-time online chatting application such as Facebook Messenger or Line. With their assistance, the Internet can send our electronic messages to the recipients less than a second, no matter where the recipient is. Therefore, such applications can indeed shorten the distance among people, and the communication efficiency is in turn increased.    

​	Next, people cares about their social networks, and spending more time on such technologies can broaden the social networks and build much more connections among people. Take the leading firm of social media – Facebook as an example. Not only people can share their interesting recent experience with their friends by the so-called “posts,” but they can also find “mutual friends” to get know of someone who has similar interest, profession, or hometown. Through the interaction, sharing, and chatting, even two strangers can still get familiar with each other, and become friends eventually. Apparently, spending time on the social media can really increase the size of one’s social network.

​            Last but not least, if we put the technology aside, the communication between people can be of no convenience. Take the traditional physical mail for example. People need to write a letter, put it in an envelope, buy stamps, and, finally, go to the post office to send out one mail. What’s worse, if there are any tiny mistakes made on the trivial stuffs mentioned above, the letters cannot be successfully sent to the recipient. Consequently, traditional communication approach is considerably not convenient nor reliable. On the contrary, if people spend more time on the communication technologies, all the annoying procedures can be skipped. Instead, we can directly send a text message, a voice mail, or even a picture with just a few clicks. Evidently, spending time on such technologies is always a better choice.  

​            To conclude, I am deeply convinced that people should spend more time on the communication technologies, and such technology can undoubtedly change people’s way of communication. All in all, not only because this is the future trend, but efficiency, social network, and convenience also means a lot to the current society.
